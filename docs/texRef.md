# Create Texture Reference Pose

![img](img/texRef.jpg)

Adds a Texture Reference Pose modifier to the top of the modifier stack for selected meshes, assigning a Pref attribute to the object. Used to lock or "stick" a Triplanar (Box) projected texture map to the surface. As the surface animates or deforms, the texture stays with the surface. 

Appears in the N-Panel, Object menu, and in the Modifiers Properties tab.
