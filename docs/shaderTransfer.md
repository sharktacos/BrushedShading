# Asset Shader Transfer

![img](img/shaderTransfer.jpg)

Transfers shader bindings between two assets with parallel object hierarchies. Used, for example, to transfer materials from a lookdev asset onto its corresponding animated Alembic cache.

Usage: Select the root node of the destination first (the asset receiving the materials such as an animated Alembic cache), then the parallel root node of the source (the asset with the materials).

Located in the Objects menu, the N-Panel, and in Object Properties.
