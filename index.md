# Brushed Shading for Blender

![img](docs/img/FeiFei_BrushShade_v2.jpg)

*Brushed Shading for Blender* is a suite of tools for achieving painterly stylized looks in both EEEVEE and Cycles. It does this by transforming regular smooth shading into hand-painted brush stroke shading.

Because it works with hand-painted brush strokes, there are almost endless artistic looks you can achieve with it, including watercolor, oil paint, pastel, palette knife, pencil sketch, and on and on.

*Brushed Shading for Blender* is divided up into add-ons, which extend Blender’s functionality to make the workflow possible, and a Material Asset library of both the components you’ll need to build the shader node network, as well as example materials showing the kind of looks you can build.
