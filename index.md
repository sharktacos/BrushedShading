*Brushed Shading for Blender* is a suite of tools for achieving painterly stylized looks in both EEEVEE and Cycles render. It does this by transforming regular smooth shading into hand-painted brush stroke shading.

## Material Asset Library

Because Brushed Shading works with hand-painted brush strokes, there are almost endless artistic looks you can achieve. The material library comes with several examples, including watercolor, oil paint, pastel, palette knife, and pencil sketch. You can make your own custom brushes to get your own personal style.

## Material Asset Library - Shader Nodes

The Asset library includes the components you’ll need to build a Brushed Shading material node network. Each shader node is detailed below in the linked documentation pages.

## Installation

Brushed Shading is packaged as a Blender Extension. So installing and maintaining is a breeze. See the Blender docs <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/extensions.html" target="_blank">Get Extensions</a> page for details.

## Resources

Inside the zip file, you will also find many resources, including 

- In the *examples* folder, you'll find a blender scene with the awesome FeiFei model by Leo Rezende for you to try out. The scene comes with texture maps and brushed shading materials.
