*Brushed Shading for Blender* is a suite of tools for achieving painterly stylized looks in both EEEVEE and Cycles render. It does this by transforming regular smooth shading into hand-painted brush stroke shading.

## Material Asset Library

Because Brushed Shading works with hand-painted brush strokes, there are almost endless artistic looks you can achieve. The material library comes with several examples, including watercolor, oil paint, pastel, palette knife, and pencil sketch. You can make your own custom brushes to get your own personal style.
